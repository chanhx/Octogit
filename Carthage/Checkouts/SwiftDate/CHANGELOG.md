## CHANGELOG

### SwiftDate 4.0.8

#### New Features
* [#214](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/214), Added `.next(day:)` both for `Date` and `DateInRegion` to get the next weekday (ie. "next friday from today") after specified date.
* [#310](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/310) Added static func `.dates(between:and:increment:)` both for `Date` and `DateInRegion` which allows to enumerate dates between two interval with given increment in term of `DateComponents`.
* [#337](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/337) DateComponents now implements `.in()` func you can use to express an interval (like using `TimeInterval`) in terms of other time units (for example `let x = 120.seconds.in(.minute)` will return 2 minutes).
* [#348](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/348) `DateComponents` can now be merged using `&&` operator. So if you have `A = 1.hours, 3.minutes, 2.seconds` and `B = 1.year, 40.minutes`, using `let C = A && B` you will get a new `DateComponents` instance with: `C = 1.year, 1.hours, 43.minutes, 2.seconds`.
* [#340](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/340), [#320](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/320) Added Spanish support (thanks to @Sepho and @adrimarti).
* [#323](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/323), Added Korean support (thanks to @KisukPark).
* [#328](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/328), Added Slovak support (thanks to @beretis).
* [#329](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/329), Added Danish support (thanks to @emilpedersen).
* [#331](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/331), Added Czech support (thanks to @rbukovansky).
* [#187](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/187), Added `.startWeek` (get the first day of the sender's week) and `.endWeek` (get the last day of the sender's week) both for `Date` and `DateInRegion`

#### Fixes:
Released on: Thu Dec 1, 2016, [Download](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/releases/tag/4.0.8)
* [#344](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/344) `.inDateDefaultRegion()` is also used as standard value for region in `.add()` function of the `Date` object

* [#346](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/346) Workaround to fix a rounding problem when comparing two `Date` or `DateInRegion` in terms of `.nanosecond` granularity. Now the comparision result is correct.
* [#315](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/315), Fixed an issue with `Date().add(components:)` and daylight saving dates.
* [#319](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/319), Added missing translation for german loc (thanks to @jaweinkauff)

### SwiftDate 4.0.3
Released on: Mon Oct 3, 2016, [Download](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/releases/tag/4.0.3)

Changes:
* [#271](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/271): Added fallback to english translation when required translation is not available for colloquial functions
* [#112](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/112): Fixed an issue when optimization level is `-fast`
* [#269](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/269): Fixed unnecessary strings printed in console when using `.timeComponents()` function
* [#266](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/266): Removed unnecessary `Region.copy()` function
* [#267](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/267): `.absoluteDate` is now a public property for `DateInRegion`
* [#268](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/268): Added new german translation to `SwiftDate.bundle`

* [#274](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/274): Fixed a bug with padding in Time Components formatter. Now SwiftDate uses `DateComponentsFormatter` internally; old timeComponents/timeComponentsSinceNow (in Date and DateInRegion) are now deprecated (there are other functions with the same name which takes a `ComponentsFormatterOptions` struct as input). Also `.string()` function in `TimeInterval` is now replaced by a counterpart which take `ComponentsFormatterOptions` struct.
* [#275](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/275): `.formatter.useSharedFormatters` in `DateInRegion` is now accessible so, if strictly needed user can user a custom instance of DateTime Formatters per single `DateInRegion`.

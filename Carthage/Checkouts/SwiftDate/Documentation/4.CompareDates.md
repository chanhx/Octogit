## Compare Dates
Date objects can be compared with the regular math comparison operators:
- `==` left hand side represents the same moment in time as the right hand side.
- `!=` left hand side is not at the same moment as the right hand side.
- `<` left hand side is earlier than the right hand side.
- `>` left hand side is later than the right hand side.
- `<=` left hand side is earlier than- or at the same moment as the right hand side.
- `>=` left hand side is later than- or at the same moment as the right hand side.

Other comparisons are in the functions:
